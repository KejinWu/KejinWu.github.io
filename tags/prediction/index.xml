      <title>(Working) Scalable Subsampling Inference for Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>We propose a scalable subsampling method on estimating standard fully connected DNN. It turns out that the mean square error bound of estimation based on DNN to a target regression function can be improved under mild conditions. Moreover, it can run faster than training a single DNN on the whole dataset. In addition, we propose various methods to estimate the bias order of DNN, build confidence and prediction intervals based on DNN.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap prediction inference of nonlinear autoregressive models</title>

      <description>We construct bootstrap prediction intervals in the multi-step ahead prediction problem with parametric model estimator; in particular, we develop an asymptotically valid quantile prediction interval as well as a pertinent prediction interval for future values. To correct the undercoverage of prediction intervals with finite samples, we further employ predictive&amp;mdash;as opposed to fitted&amp;mdash;residuals in the bootstrap process.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step-Ahead prediction intervals for nonparametric autoregressions via Bootstrap: consistency, debiasing, and pertinence</title>

      <description>We consider a forward bootstrap approach with non-parametric model estimator to resolve the difficulty on predicting multi-step ahead time series data. We construct a quantile prediction interval that is asymptotically valid. Moreover, after taking a debiasing technique, we can build pertinent prediction intervals in which the estimation variability is captured. (This is my first paper with my advisor Professor Politis. Thanks for his guidance!)</description>
